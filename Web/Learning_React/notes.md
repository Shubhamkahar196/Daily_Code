# Why react ?
- we can use state which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page
- we can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- react use a virtual dom to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
Debugging and maintainance is easy

# Components
- In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. 
- They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be thought of as custom, self-contained HTML elements.

# Props
- Props are the way to pass data from component to another component.

# hooks: useState
- useState is a Hook that lets you add state to functional components.
- It returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.

# state 
- A variable that stores a value. 
- In this case, count is a state variable that stores a number.  

# useEffect
- its a hook that runs a function after something changes.
- it's like a "listener" that waits for something to happen.
- When that the things happen, it runs the function.
