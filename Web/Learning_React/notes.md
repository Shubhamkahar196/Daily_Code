# Why react ?
- we can use state which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page
- we can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- react use a virtual dom to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
Debugging and maintainance is easy

# Components
-In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. 
-They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be thought of as custom, self-contained HTML elements.

# Props
-Props are the way to pass data from component to another component.
