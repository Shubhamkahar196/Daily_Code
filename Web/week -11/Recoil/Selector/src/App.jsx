// selector
// In Recoil, a selector is a function that:

// 1. Derives new data from atoms (state pieces).
// 2. Can be used to compute and return new values based on atoms.
// 3. Automatically updates when the underlying atoms change.

// Selectors help you:

// - Transform data
// - Combine data from multiple atoms
// - Optimize performance by only recalculating when necessary

// Think of selectors as a way to create new, derived state that's based on existing atoms!
